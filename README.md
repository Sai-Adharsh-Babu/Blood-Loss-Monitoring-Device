# Blood Loss Monitoring Device  
### *A Concept Prototype for a Wearable Medical Device*

---

## Overview  
The **Blood Loss Monitoring Device** is a **conceptual prototype** of a **wearable medical system** designed to estimate and monitor blood loss in trauma or surgical environments.  

Developed as part of a **second-year Biomedical Engineering university module**, this project emphasizes **product design**, **feasibility analysis**, and **regulatory research**—focusing on **how such a device could be realized** rather than building the actual electronic system.  

---

## Project Scope  
This repository showcases the **conceptual development** of the device, including:  
- A **CAD-based 3D design** of the wearable system.  
- **Feasibility studies** covering the proposed sensing methods and operational principles.  
- **Regulatory research** into relevant **ISO and medical device standards** required for eventual real-world implementation.  
- A **3D-printed demonstration model** used for presentation purposes.  

> **Note:** This project is a **design prototype only**.  
> No electronic, sensing, or functional hardware components were implemented.
